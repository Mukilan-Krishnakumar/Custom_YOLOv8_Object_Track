### Project Showcase



### Getting Started
Download and Unzip this repository. Navigate to the repository in terminal and type the following:

```Bash
conda create -n yolo_env python==3.8

conda activate yolo_env

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch

pip install -U ultralytics wandb

pip install supervision==0.3

pip install selenium
```

These are all the dependencies of the project, navigate to `1_Data_Collection` and start running `data_collection.py`. 

### Project Description üåå 

The Wildlife Tracker Project is an Object Tracker customized for tracking Wildlife in India. This project is part of a collaborative effort with Weights and Biases to create a beginner friendly introduction to YOLOv8. 

It detects and tracks six classes of animals: 

| Class | Animal|
|------|--------|
|0|Tiger üêØ|
|1|Elephant üêò| 
|2|Rhinoceros ü¶è| 
|3|Bison ü¶¨| 
|4|Leopard üêÜ| 
|5|Lion ü¶Å|

This project guides you through every step of Object Tracking Pipeline. The pipeline is discuessed briefly:
1. Data Collection: In the Data Collection step, we use Selenium library to Automate WebScraping and saving animal images.
2. Data Annotation: We use ModifiedOpenLabeling (by Ivan Goncharov) to Annotate Images and save it using Custom Train Test Split. 
3. Experiment Tracking with W&B: We upload our dataset as `wandb.Artifact` and visualize our image along with the bounding boxes. Explained in-depth in the blog post (Linked below).
4. Custom Training YOLOv8: We train YOLOv8 with our Scraped Data. We train and log metrics to `wandb`
5. Custom Tracking with YOLOv8: We use the native tracking support provided by `ultralytics` and track with two SOTA tracking algorithms : `BoTSORT` and `ByteTrack`. 

It also has interactive exercises to keep you engaged!
